## [Introduction](#introduction)
When you call `setState()`, the component's state isn't updated immediately. Instead, React creates an update object and places it into a queue within the fiber associated with the component. \
React then schedules the component to re-render by calling `scheduleUpdateOnFiber()`. During the re-rendering process, React invokes the `renderWithHooks()` function, which manages the lifecycle of hooks, including `useState`. Depending on whether the hook is being used for the first time or during a subsequent render, React will either mount or update the hook accordingly.

## [Rules of Hooks](#rules-of-hooks)
Before diving deeper, it's essential to understand some key rules that govern how hooks, including useState, should be used. In this blog, I will explain the reasoning behind these rules:

- **Hooks must be called at the top level**\
Hooks should always be called at the top level of a React function component or a custom hook. They should not be called conditionally, inside loops, or within nested functions. This ensures hooks are invoked in the same order each time a component renders, which is crucial for React to correctly preserve the state across multiple renders.

- **Avoid Directly Calling a React Component Function**\
Directly calling a React component function can lead to unexpected behavior because it bypasses React's rendering lifecycle, including state management and effect cleanup. Components should be used in JSX or via React.createElement().

 - **State Updates During Render Are an Anti-Pattern**\
State updates triggered during the render phase can lead to unintended side effects and may cause React to enter an infinite loop. Thus, such practices are generally discouraged.

- **Asynchronous Nature of `setState()`**\
`setState()` is asynchronous, meaning it schedules an update and then exits. The actual state change doesn’t happen immediately during the current function execution. Any code relying on the updated state running right after `setState()` will encounter the old state value until the next render.

- **React Batches `setState()` Calls**\
To optimize performance, React batches multiple setState() calls into a single update. This means that multiple setState() calls during the same synchronous execution cycle will result in a single re-render at the end of the event handling, ensuring the component only re-renders once per batch.




## [1. Three Implementations of `useState`](#1-three-implementations-of-usestate)

Each hook in React is implemented in three forms:
- **mountFoo** (`HooksDispatcherOnMount`): Initializes the hook during the component's initial render.
- **updateFoo** (`HooksDispatcherOnUpdate`): Updates the hook's state or re-applies effects based on the changes since the last render.
- **renderFoo** (`HooksDispatcherOnRerender`): Handles re-renders that occur without a change in state, props, or context. Typically due to a parent component's re-render, and for double invoking components in Dev Strict Mode. It does not update the hook state but checks for consistency, ensuring the hooks' identity and order remain stable across renders.

React handles hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` through a dispatcher mechanism, which ensures that the correct implementation of a hook is called based on the rendering phase—whether the component is being rendered for the first time (mount) or during subsequent renders (update).

When a hook like `useState` or `useEffect` is invoked, it internally calls `resolveDispatcher()`, which accesses `ReactCurrentDispatcher` to retrieve and execute the correct hook implementation.
For example, `useState()` is implemented as follows:
```
export function useState<S>(
  initialState: (() => S) | S,
): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {
  const dispatcher = resolveDispatcher();
  return dispatcher.useState(initialState);
}

```
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js#L80


The `renderWithHooks()` function is responsible for rendering components that use hooks. It configures `ReactCurrentDispatcher` to reference either the `mountFoo` or `updateFoo` implementations, depending on whether the component is being rendered for the first time or has already been rendered.

You may refer the function `renderWithHooks()` code from here
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.new.js#L415

```typescript
if (__DEV__) {
if (current !== null && current.memoizedState !== null) {
ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = HooksDispatcherOnUpdateInDEV;
} else if (hookTypesDev !== null) {
// This dispatcher handles an edge case where a component is updating,
// but no stateful hooks have been used.
// We want to match the production code behavior (which will use HooksDispatcherOnMount),
// but with the extra DEV validation to ensure hooks ordering hasn't changed.
// This dispatcher does that.
ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = HooksDispatcherOnMountWithHookTypesInDEV;
} else {
ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = HooksDispatcherOnMountInDEV;
}
} else {
ReactCurrentDispatcher.current =
current === null || current.memoizedState === null
? HooksDispatcherOnMount
: HooksDispatcherOnUpdate;
}
...

// Check if there was a render phase update
if (didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass) {
  ...
   ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = __DEV__
          ? HooksDispatcherOnRerenderInDEV
        : HooksDispatcherOnRerender;
}

```

## [2. State Initialization](#2-state-initialization)
During the initial render of a component, when `useState()` is called, `resolveDispatcher()` returns the `mountState()` method. `mountState()` internally invokes `mountWorkInProgressHook()`, which creates a hook object stored as `memoizedState` in the corresponding fiber. This allows React to maintain the state across renders.

![mountState](/static/images/posts/how-useState-hook-works-internally-in-react-18/mount-state.png)

The first hook used in a function component is stored in the `memoizedState` property of the fiber. Subsequent hooks are stored in a linked-list manner, where the second is stored in `memoizedState.next`, the third in `memoizedState.next.next`, and so on.

`mountState()` returns a state variable along with a bound version of the `dispatchSetState()` function. Consequently, the setter function provided by the `useState` hook is effectively a bound version of `dispatchSetState()`.

In the example below, the Counter component demonstrates how useState hooks are organized in the fiber's `memoizedState`:
```
export function Counter() {
  const [count1, setCount1] = useState(10);
  const [count2, setCount2] = useState(100);
  const [count3, setCount3] = useState(1000);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount1((prev) => prev + 1);
    setCount1((prev) => prev + 2);
    setCount2((prev) => prev + 200);

    startTransition(() => {
      setCount3((prev) => prev + 3000);
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h2> Counter1: {count1}</h2>
      <h2> Counter2: {count2}</h2>
      <h2> Counter3: {count3}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increase</button>
    </>
  );
}

```

If hooks were declared within loops or conditional structures, the hook list in the work-in-progress fiber might differ from the current fiber across renders. This mismatch can cause the hook states to become misaligned between the current and work-in-progress fibers, which is why hooks should not be declared inside loops or conditions.

## [3. The `interleaved` Queue (`memoizedState.queue.interleaved`)](#3-the-interleaved-queue-memoizedstatequeueinterleaved)
When the setter function `dispatchSetState()` is invoked, it creates an update object containing the update details, such as the action (callback) and update priority. `dispatchSetState()` then invokes `enqueueConcurrentHookUpdate()` to store this update object into the fiber.

If there is no existing update object in the fiber, this new update object is stored as `fiber.memoizedState.queue.interleaved`. If the setter function is invoked multiple times, subsequent update objects are stored in a circular linked list. This design enhances performance, allowing React to efficiently manage and append new update objects.

The last update object points back to `fiber.memoizedState.queue.interleaved`, forming a circular linked list. This design improves performance by allowing React to efficiently append new update objects to the list, while also enabling direct access to the last node (the interleaved node). Additionally, finding the first node is straightforward since it is simply the next node after the last node.

In the example above, the memoizedState and updates objects are depicted as follows:

## [4. The `pending` Queue (`memoizedState.queue.pending`)](#4-the-pending-queue-memoizedstatequeuepending)

There are three types of pending update queues:
1. `interleaved` Queue: Stores updates that occur outside the render phase.
2. `baseQueue`: Stores updates that were skipped due to lower priority during the current processing.
3. `pending` Queue: Stores updates that will be processed in the next `updateReducer()` call.

![pending-update-queue](/static/images/posts/how-useState-hook-works-internally-in-react-18/pending-update-queue.png)


Before `updateReducer()` is invoked, both the `interleaved` and `baseQueue` are merged into the `pending` queue.


![finishQueueingConcurrentUpdates-screenshot](/static/images/posts/how-useState-hook-works-internally-in-react-18/finishQueueingConcurrentUpdates-screenshot.png)


When a state update is triggered during the render phase, React cannot immediately re-render the component because it is already in the middle of the rendering process. In this scenario, `dispatchSetState()` invokes `enqueueRenderPhaseUpdate()` to queue the update object into `memoizedState.queue.pending`. React processes these pending updates after the current render is completed, which may lead to another render to apply the state changes.

However, triggering state updates during the render phase is generally considered an **anti-pattern**, as it can lead to unintended side effects and potentially cause React to enter an infinite loop.

The state updates during the render phase is illustrated as below:
```
export function Counter() {
  const [count1, setCount1] = useState(1);
  const [count2, setCount2] = useState(10);

  // This state update is triggered during the render phase
  if(count2 === 20) {
    setCount2(prev => prev + 20);

    // eslint-disable-next-line no-debugger
    debugger;
  }

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount1((prev) => {
      return prev + 1;
    });

    setCount2((prev) => {
      return prev + 10;
    });
  };

  return (<>
    <h2> Counter1: {count1}</h2>
    <h2> Counter2: {count2}</h2>
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Increase</button>
  </>);
}

```

## [5. State Updates](#5-state-updates)
- When a `setState()` method is invoked, if the `memoizedState.queue.interleaved` queue is empty, React can compute the next state immediately. If the new state is the same as the current state, React skips scheduling a re-render, allowing an early bailout.

- Otherwise, React creates an update object representing the update information, stores it in the fiber, and schedules a re-render.

During the re-render:

(a) React invokes `finishQueueingConcurrentUpdates()` to merge updates from the `interleaved` queue into the `pending` queue.

(b) `renderWithHooks()` is called, configuring ReactCurrentDispatcher to point to the `updateState()` implementations.

(c) `renderWithHooks()` then invokes the component function to create a new fiber. During the component function's execution, `useState()` is invoked, which now points to the `updateState()` implementation. Internally, `updateState()` calls `updateReducer()` to process the pending updates.


(d) `updateReducer()` first merges the updates in the pending queue into a base queue and then traverses the base queue, executing callbacks for the updates that match the current update priority. Updates that do not meet the required priority are stored back in the base queue, awaiting the next rendering cycle to be processed.


The call graph for render process is illustrated as below:
